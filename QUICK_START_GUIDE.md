## How to Use This Repository

### The Right Way to Learn

**DO** ✅:
1. **Read the learning material first** (from learning repository)
2. **Attempt implementation yourself** before looking at solutions
3. **Compare your approach** with the provided solution
4. **Understand the reasoning** behind implementation choices
5. **Run the solution** and experiment with modifications
6. **Add new features** to extend your understanding

**DON'T** ❌:
1. Copy-paste code without understanding
2. Skip attempting implementation yourself
3. Ignore test files (they reveal important patterns)
4. Skip documentation (README, STEP_BY_STEP)
5. Work through exercises out of order
