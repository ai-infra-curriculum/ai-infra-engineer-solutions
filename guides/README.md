## üí° Best Practices

### Debugging
1. **Always measure before optimizing** - Use profiling tools
2. **Follow systematic methodology** - Don't guess, test hypotheses
3. **Document your findings** - Help future you and your team
4. **Use the right tools** - Match tool to the problem

### Optimization
1. **Profile to find bottlenecks** - 80/20 rule applies
2. **Measure impact** - Before/after benchmarks required
3. **Consider trade-offs** - Performance vs. complexity
4. **Optimize hot paths first** - Focus on critical code

### Production Readiness
1. **Security first** - Never compromise on security
2. **Test everything** - Especially disaster recovery
3. **Monitor continuously** - You can't fix what you can't see
4. **Document thoroughly** - Runbooks save time during incidents
5. **Automate where possible** - Reduce human error
