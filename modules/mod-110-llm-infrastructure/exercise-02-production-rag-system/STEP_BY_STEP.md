# Step-by-Step Implementation Guide: Production RAG System

## Overview

This guide walks through the complete implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation system.

## Learning Objectives

By following this guide, you will learn:
- [Key concept 1]
- [Key concept 2]
- [Key concept 3]

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- [ ] Python 3.11+ installed
- [ ] Virtual environment created
- [ ] Required dependencies installed
- [ ] Access to necessary resources

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Project Setup (15 minutes)

**Objective**: Set up the project structure and dependencies

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Verification**:
```bash
python -c "import sys; print(sys.version)"
# Should show Python 3.11+
```

### Step 2: [Next Major Component] (XX minutes)

**Objective**: [What this step accomplishes]

**Implementation**:

1. Create the file `src/[filename].py`
2. Implement the core logic
3. Add error handling
4. Write tests
