# Artificial Intelligence Overview

## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction.

## Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

### Types of Machine Learning

1. **Supervised Learning**: The algorithm learns from labeled training data
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: The algorithm finds patterns in unlabeled data
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: The algorithm learns through trial and error

## Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers. These deep neural networks are capable of learning complex patterns in large amounts of data.

### Applications

- Image recognition and classification
- Natural language processing
- Speech recognition
- Autonomous vehicles
- Medical diagnosis

## Natural Language Processing

NLP enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Key tasks include:

- Text classification
- Named entity recognition
- Machine translation
- Sentiment analysis
- Question answering

## Future of AI

The future of AI holds immense potential across various domains including healthcare, finance, education, and transportation. However, it also raises important ethical questions about privacy, bias, and the impact on employment.
